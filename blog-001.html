        <h1>How I Made a Racial Diversity Poster in Photoshop</h1>
        <img class="blog-image" src="images/Blog 001/final poster.png" alt="A poster encouraging the celebration of racial diversity.">
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>THE BRIEF</h3>
        <p>Create an image set in the 1950s that tells a compelling story. It must include three symbols that reference the 1950s.</p>
        <br>  
        <h3>THE SYMBOLS</h3>
        <p>I chose Atomic Design (the starburst clock), colour TV, and the first Barbie doll (in the girl's hand).</p>
        <br>
        <h3>THE STORY</h3>
        <p>I wanted to tell a story about embracing diversity, and how it is a strength rather than a point of division. I like to think of a diamond in the sunshine as it refracts the light into the full spectrum of colour. In this analogy, each one of those colours represents the individuals in the human race. (Not just in terms of skin colour, but personality, purpose, strengths & weaknessess. Everything that makes us unique. But for the purpose of this image, the message is focused on race.) We are beautiful on our own, but our beauty is even stronger when we embrace our diversity.</p> 
        <br>
        <h3>CONCEPT SKETCH</h3>
        <img class="blog-image image-border" src="images/Blog 001/sketch.PNG" alt="A sketch of a TV storefront window with a person looking in from outside. The TVs all show an image of a diamond in the hands of two different skin colours, and rainbow light is pouring out. A banner reads 'Stronger Together'.">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Through this project, I discovered that sketching is a really useful part of ideation, even if your drawing skills are basic. I was pretty set on a different layout, until pushed to create more sketches (this was number 3), which led me to a better idea than what I had originally. Always try to push yourself beyond your first idea :)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>ASSETS</h3>
        <p>I sourced numerous assets to create this piece. Most are from Unsplash (free) or Adobe Stock (paid). I've included links to each of them.</p>
        <h4>The storefront</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <h4>The background wall of the storefront window</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <h4>The glass reflection</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <h4>The clock</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <h4>The TV stack</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <h4>The image on the TV screens</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <h4>The digital decay for the TV screens (3 types) </h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <h4>The rainbow burst</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <h4>The paper texture</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Text</h3>
        <p>Fonts used were Uberhand Pro Black for "Stronger", and Quimby Gubernatorial for "Together", both Adobe Fonts. The line embellishments & diamond illustration I created myself, and assembled in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Original Content</h3>
        <p>The girl is a picture I took of myself, styled to appear younger and within the 1950s theme.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>HELPFUL RESOURCES</h3>
        <p>I followed this YouTube tutorial by photoshopCAFE to create the girl's shadow: <a href="https://youtu.be/5TuhBcN9k8w">https://youtu.be/5TuhBcN9k8w</a></p>
