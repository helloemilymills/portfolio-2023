        <h1>How I Made a Diversity Poster in Photoshop</h1>
        <p>Published 4th June 2023</p>
        <br>
        <img class="blog-image" src="../images/Blog 001/final poster.png" alt="A poster encouraging the celebration of racial diversity.">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><em>This project was completed as part of a university assignment.</em></p>
        <br>
        <h3>THE BRIEF</h3>
        <p>Create an image set in the 1950s that tells a compelling story. It must include three symbols that reference the 1950s.</p>
        <br>  
        <h3>THE SYMBOLS</h3>
        <p>I chose Atomic Design (the starburst clock), colour TV, and the first Barbie doll (in the girl's hand).</p>
        <br>
        <h3>THE STORY</h3>
        <p>I wanted to tell a story about embracing diversity, and how it is a strength rather than a point of division. I like to think of a diamond in the sunshine as it refracts the light into the full spectrum of colour. In this analogy, each one of those colours represents the individuals in the human race. (Not just in terms of skin colour, but personality, purpose, strengths & weaknessess. Everything that makes us unique. But for the purpose of this image, the message is focused on race.) We are beautiful on our own, but our beauty is even stronger when we embrace our diversity.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>This poster shows a young girl as she stops to look at the window display of a TV store. The coloured light captures her attention, and she's drawn to the message of the TVs. She comprehends that, like light refracting through a diamond, our differences are beautiful. She will walk away, but the message will stay with her. She’ll grow up knowing that we’re stronger together.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>CONCEPT SKETCH</h3>
        <img class="blog-image image-border" src="../images/Blog 001/sketch.PNG" alt="A sketch of a TV storefront window with a person looking in from outside. The TVs all show an image of a diamond in the hands of two different skin colours, and rainbow light is pouring out. A banner reads 'Stronger Together'.">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Through this project, I discovered that sketching is a really useful part of ideation, even if your drawing skills are basic. I was pretty set on a different layout, until pushed to create more sketches (this was number 3), which led me to a better idea than what I had originally. It's worthwhile to push yourself beyond your first idea :)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>ASSETS</h3>
        <p>I sourced numerous assets to create this piece, and I've included links to each of them. Most are from Adobe Stock, but a few are from Unsplash, which is a great alternative for free images.</p>
        <h4>The storefront:</h4>

        <p>I cropped this down to use only the right side. I made a selection of the windows and deleted them.</p>
        <h4>The background wall of the storefront window:</h4>

        <p>I placed this on a layer behind the storefront to add a backing to the window. I liked the lighting on this wall.</p>
        <h4>The glass reflection:</h4>

        <p>I cropped this down to just the window (right side), placed it behind the storefront layer, changed the blend mode, and played with the opacity until I had created a glass effect for my windows.</p>
        <h4>The clock:</h4>

        <p>I removed the background, and added this behind the window layer.</p>
        <h4>The TV stack:</h4>

        <p>I removed the background, and added this behind the window layer.</p>
        <h4>The image on the TV screens:</h4>

        <p>I duplicated this image to place one behind each of the nine TV screens, and changed the blend mode so it wasn't so stark.</p>
        <h4>The digital decay for the TV screens (3 types):</h4>

        </p>
        <p>I wanted the TV screens to be subtly different from each other (since they are different models) and also to have some of the pixelation or digital decay that we might expect from an old TV. So I used these three types of 'digital decay' across the nine TVs, with different blend modes and opacities to create variation.</p>
        <h4>The rainbow burst:</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="../images/Blog 001/rainbow burst.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Credit: https://stock.adobe.com/au/images/%E8%83%8C%E6%99%AF%E7%B4%A0%E6%9D%90%E3%80%80%E3%83%97%E3%83%AA%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A0%E3%80%80%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A9%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A9/385204509</p>
        <p>I changed the blend mode & opacity, and used a few copies of this to add smaller and larger bursts. These sit outside the store window (above the storefront layer) and bring attention to the colour TVs (in contrast to the rest of the image being in black and white).</p>
        <h4>The paper texture:</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="../images/Blog 001/aged paper.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Credit: https://stock.adobe.com/au/images/old-brown-paper/59198396</p>
        <p>I wanted to bring some warmth to the image, as well as a vintage texture. I edited the blend mode, and placed this on top of the rest of the image (with the exception of the text layer).</p>
        <h4>The barbie:</h4>
        <img class="blog-image" src="../images/Blog 001/1950s barbie.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Credit: https://stock.adobe.com/au/images/vintage-bubrby-doll-in-striped-swimsuit-on-deck-chair-exhibition-at-the-titiqaqa-museum-russia-st-petersburg-august-2020/459097086 </p>
        <p>I removed the background and placed her into the hand of the girl. I moved one of barbie's arms onto a separate layer and rotated it to give the appearance of the girl holding the barbie by her arm.</p>
        <h3>The storefront text:</h3>
        <p>Fonts used were Uberhand Pro Black for "Stronger", and Quimby Gubernatorial for "Together", both Adobe Fonts. The line embellishments & diamond illustration I created myself, and assembled in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        <h3>Original content:</h3>
        <p>The girl is a picture I took of myself, styled to appear younger and within the 1950s theme.</p>
        <br>
